This application is a WIP for the company Sensory Pets, meant to act as a landing page for a specific subset of their B2C marketing. It was built using Next.js, React, and Framer Motion. Please check out the etsy page for the company at: https://www.etsy.com/shop/sensorypets/ and follow on Facebook if you are interested in their work!

## Future Feature Ideas:
[//]: <>

There are a few items for this project to make it fully feature complete, specifically:
1. Enable users to select a dark or light theme
2. Build rotating / random selection of backgrounds to help user experience for returning visitors
3. Connect more directly to Etsy marketplace and Facebook page for Sensory Pets shop
